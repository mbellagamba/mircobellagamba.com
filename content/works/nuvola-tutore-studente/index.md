I worked on the renewal of the parents and students area. The project involved developing a new React Native app and a complete rewrite of the web app. Both the mobile and web apps share the same core technologies: written in TypeScript, React with Hooks and Context API for state management, Jest and Testing Library as testing tools. For the web app, we adopted a micro-frontend approach for flexible integration with legacy code and an independent deploy pipeline.
