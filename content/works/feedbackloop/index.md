The FeedbackLoop platform backing the React Native app is completely serverless and cloud native. I designed the AWS cloud architecture involving the orchestration of several services like AWS Lambda, RDS Aurora Serverless, S3, CloudFront, Cognito, CloudWatch, API Gateway, VPC. Lambda functions runs C# code on .NET Core runtime. The React Native app uses JavaScript, Redux, AWS Amplify, Styled Components, Jest, Enzyme.
