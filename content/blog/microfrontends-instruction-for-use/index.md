Adopting a microfrontends architecture is a great way to scale the frontend of large applications. But what is the real cost of this choice? What are the decisions to be made and the difficulties to face in this process? Speaking of a case study that I have dealt with personally, I present the main decisions made, the major obstacles encountered and the most critical implementation details that characterized my experience of migrating from multipage application to microfrontends.

In this my very first experience as speaker, I explain how we leverage the microfrontends architecture to evolve our software. I would like to thank MUG (Marca User Group) for giving me this opportunity and for organizing the live streaming. If you missed it you can still find it on Youtube (Italian language).
