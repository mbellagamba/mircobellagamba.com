This is the first project I have done as a freelance. I developed the native Android app and the PHP Rest API. In this project I have used and learned many of the APIs of the Android operating system: from Activities and XML layouts to SQLite and file system but also Intents, background tasks, Receivers, Google Maps, GeoFence API. This project is now archived.
